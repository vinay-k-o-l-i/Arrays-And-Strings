# Arrays-And-Strings
##  Aim
To implement basic problems based on arrays in C++ such as:
- Traversal
- Linear Search
- Finding the Smallest and Largest Values
- Reversing an Array
- Calculating Sum and Average

##  Theory
Arrays are fundamental data structures that store elements of the same data type at contiguous memory locations. Operations like searching, traversing, and modifying arrays are key skills required for problem-solving in programming and technical interviews. This repository demonstrates these operations through five simple programs.

## Programs Summary

### 1. *Array Traversal Program*

*Aim*: Display all elements of a predefined array using a loop.

*Algorithm*:
1. Initialize an array with 5 integers.
2. Use a for loop to traverse and print each element.

*Code Explanation*:
This program initializes an array with elements {50, 60, 70, 80, 90} and uses a loop to print each item.

###  2. *Linear Search in Array*

*Aim*: Search an element in an array using linear search.
*Algorithm*:
1. Initialize an array with 5 fixed numbers.
2. Take user input to search.
3. Traverse the array.
4. If element matches, print index and exit.
5. If not found, print not found.

*Code Explanation*:
Uses an array {13, 54, 878, 9, 0} and searches for user-input integer via linear search.
### 3. *Find Smallest and Largest Elements*
*Aim*: Find the smallest and largest elements in a user-defined array.

*Algorithm*:
1. Take array size and elements as input.
2. Set first value as initial smallest/largest.
3. Use loop to compare and update these values.
4. Display both values.

*Code Explanation*:
The program scans all user inputs and dynamically tracks min and max.

### 4. *Reverse an Array*

*Aim*: Reverse a user-defined array and display the result.

*Algorithm*:
1. Take input for number of elements.
2. Read array elements.
3. Traverse the array from last to first to display it in reverse.

*Code Explanation*:
Takes size and values from the user, then prints them in reverse order using a decreasing loop.

### 5. *Sum and Average of Array Elements*

*Aim*: Calculate sum and average of elements in a user-defined array.

*Algorithm*:
1. Input n, the number of elements.
2. Read n integer values into array.
3. Accumulate values into sum.
4. Compute average = sum / n.
5. Display sum and average.

*Code Explanation*:
This program reads elements, adds them up inside the input loop, and then computes average after that.

## Conclusion

These programs collectively reinforce the understanding of arrays in C++. They help in developing the ability to think algorithmically and solve basic problems:

- Practice of loop constructs
- Array initialization and user input
- Element search and comparison
- Basic math operations (sum, average)
- Reversal logic

These kinds of programs are often asked in first-semester computer programming courses or beginner-level coding interviews.
